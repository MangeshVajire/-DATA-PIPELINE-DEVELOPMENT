DESCRIPTION : 
The data_preprocessing_pipeline.py is a robust Python module that implements a comprehensive data preprocessing solution for optimization-related tasks. The OptimizationDataPipeline class provides flexible handling of both numerical and categorical data through a unified interface. Key features include:

The pipeline supports automatic handling of missing values using median imputation for numerical features and constant value imputation for categorical features. It implements flexible scaling options with both StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, and uses OneHotEncoder for categorical variables with proper handling of feature names. The class maintains data integrity throughout transformations and provides clear error handling.

The implementation includes three main methods: create_pipeline() for initializing the preprocessing steps, fit_transform_data() for training and transforming data, and transform_data() for applying the trained pipeline to new data. The pipeline is particularly useful for optimization tasks where feature scaling and categorical encoding need to be consistent across training and inference.

The code demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing with proper documentation, clear method signatures, and example usage. It's designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to integrate into larger data processing workflows. The implementation includes proper handling of feature names throughout the transformation process, ensuring traceability of features in the transformed data.

The example usage section demonstrates practical application with sample data, showing how to handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables. The code is well-documented with docstrings and comments, making it easy for other developers to understand and use. Error handling is implemented to ensure proper pipeline initialization and usage sequence.
